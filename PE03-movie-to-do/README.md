ToDo List App

Input

The application provides an input field where users can enter task descriptions. After entering a task, users click the "Add Task" button to submit it. Each task is then displayed in the list of tasks.

Process

The application uses React's useState hook to manage the list of tasks dynamically. When the "Add Task" button is clicked, the new task is added to the state, and the UI re-renders to display the updated list. Event handlers capture user interactions, such as adding or deleting tasks. The .map() function is used to dynamically render the list of ToDo items, maintaining efficiency.

Output

The tasks entered by the user are displayed in an interactive list format. Each task is accompanied by a "Delete" button, allowing users to remove tasks from the list. The UI updates dynamically to reflect these changes, providing a responsive user experience.
